Four Shadows
============

An approach to replace conventional 5 o'clock shadow for iconography with intelliegent time-aware shadow. The direction of shadow changes based on the direction of the 'hour hand' of an analog clock. This gives user an enriched and nature experience. 

Setup
============
######1. Include jQuery and ```fourshadows.js``` into your html file.
######2. Place as many icons you need in your HTML using:

```HTML
	<div class="fs-icon-l fs-cast" data-icon="filename.png"></div>
```

######3. Include this in your CSS file:

```CSS
	.fs-icon-l {width: 512px; height: 512px;}
	.fs-icon-m {width: 256px; height: 256px;}
	.fs-icon-s {width: 128px; height: 128px;}
	.fs-icon-xs {width: 64px; height: 64px;}
```
